* General Questions 

- What is Online Shopping? 
In just a few short years, online shopping has grown to become a multi-billion 
dollar industry. The projections for the future are for it to continue to 
grow substantially. For the uninitiated, online shopping is the ability to 
purchase goods and services from the comfort of your home or office via 
your computer. User simply connects to a company's website, browse offerings, 
selects the items that he wants to purchase by inserting them into your 
"shopping cart", and then proceeding to "check-out", just as you would do 
in a regular store. 

- What is ViArt Shop? 
ViArt Shop is an electronic commerce package available to install in PHP.

The goal of ViArt Shop is to create a system capable of performing all 
of the functions needed to do business online.

ViArt Shop is distributed as three different packages Light, Standard 
and Enterprise. Therefore the list of features is different for each of them.

* MySQL specific questions 

- It tells me "ERROR 1049: Unknown database '... 
Please check your "includes/var_definition.php" file. 
Variable $db_name should contain a valid database name, e.g. 
$db_name = "c2s"; 
Run your mysql client and perform "SHOW DATABASES" command and make sure 
that the database you choosen as ViArt Shop database does exist. 
 
- If the database does not exist then create it with "CREATE DATABASE" command. 
Read more about CREATE DATABASE syntax at www.mysql.org. 

- How to add a user for my database? 
You could add a user using GRANT command. Note that user should have rights 
to select, insert, update, delete. 
A MySQL Grant statement for this user would look like this: 
GRANT 
  select, insert, update, create, alter, delete, drop 
ON 
 database.* 
TO 
 user@localhost 
IDENTIFIED BY 
 'password'; 

- How to populate my database with SQL script? 
ViArt Shop distribution contains "DB" folder that includes SQL scripts 
with database structure: 
 - MySQL_VA_Shop.sql - for MySQL Database Server 
 - PgSQL_VA_Shop.sql - for PostgreSQL 
To populate your MySQL database with MySQL_VA_Shop.sql script run MySQL 
client like the following: 

mysql -u User -p Database < MySQL_VA_Shop.sql 

- How to make a backup of my database? 
You can make a backup for MySQL db using mysqldump program distributed with MySQL. 
E.g.: 

mysqldump --opt -u User -p Database > VA_Shop_Dump.sql 

It should create file VA_Shop_Dump.sql that will contain the dump of database. 
Read more about dumping MySQL database at www.mysql.org.
