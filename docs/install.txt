ViArt v.3.3.2

Installation Guide

================================================================================

* Prerequisites: 

(a) Make sure you have a web server where the ViArt Shop will be deployed. 

(b) Make sure that your web server is capable of serving the web pages written in 
    PHP (http://www.php.net). 

(c) Make sure that Zend Optimizer 2.6.2 or higher is installed (http://www.zend.com)

(d) Make sure you have one of the supported databases installed. 
    - MySQL version 3.22.x or higher. (http://www.mysql.com) 
    - PostgreSQL 7.1 or higher (http://www.postgresql.org) 
    - ODBC connected database

(e) When you download the application, you should find the following components 
    contained in the zip archive: 

    "/" - Language specific script files and html template files are in Root folder. 
    "/docs" - Reference Manual is in "Docs" folder. 
    "/db" - SQL script files that can be used to recreate the database are in /DB folder. 
    "/images" - A folder containing images. 
    "/includes" - A folder with common used scripts and settings. 

================================================================================

* Installation: 

The installation process is pretty straightforward and requires minimal 
adjustment of the application files. Proceed as follows: 

1. Extract the files from archive 
Extract the files into a folder within your web server hierarchy from where 
the application will be served. Usually under Linux you could extract them like: 

tar xfz viart_shop-3.3.2.tar.gz 

Windows users could use WinZip to extract files from archive.

Ensure that the folder name does not have spaces in it. During the process of 
unzipping, make sure that the files are unzipped to their respective folders. 
Don't simply open the zip archive and drag all the files to the same folders. 
For the application to work correctly, some files such as the image files need 
to be in specific folders. 

================================================================================

2. Prepare a database 

If you do not have a database already, create a database. 
In MySQL you use the "mysqladmin" program like this: 
mysqladmin -uuser -ppaswword create mydb 


Be sure that you have a user for that database which has the rights to select,
insert, update, delete. 
A MySQL Grant statement for this user would look like this: 
GRANT 
  select, insert, update, create, alter, delete, drop 
ON 
 database.* 
TO 
 user@localhost 
IDENTIFIED BY 
 'password'; 

================================================================================
3. Quick Install

(a) Using your web browser visit the location you placed ViArt Shop
   e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/viart_shop

(b) Change the permissions on includes/var_definition.php to be writeable by 
all (666 or -rw-rw-rw- within your FTP Client) 

(c) The installation is divided logically in two steps. In the first part you 
   provide database settings and create database table.
   In the second part you decide which settings you want to use.
   Fill out all the requested information and hit Next each step.

(d) Change the permissions on includes/var_definition.php to be writeable only 
by yourself (644 or -rw-r--r-- within your FTP Client) 

(e) Revisit the location you entered above

(f) ViArt Shop should now be available, please MAKE SURE you read at least 
Section 5 from User Manual for important, security related post-installation 
instructions


NOTE: the following  steps are not needed if the installation had completed
successfully

================================================================================
4. Populating the database with tables structure

Go to "db" folder of your installation and populate your database server with 
information from one of the following SQL script files: 
- mysql_viart_shop.sql   - for MySQL Database Server 
- postgre_viart_shop.sql - for PostgreSQL 
- access_viart_shop.sql  - for MS Access

To populate MySQL database you could use 'mysql' client like:
mysql -uuser -ppassword mydb < mysql_viart_shop.sql

================================================================================
5. The database connection string 

Once you have unzipped the files, the next task is to alter the database 
connection string to reflect the current location/name of the database. 
Follow the relevant instructions below depending on the type of connection 
that you want to use: 

* MySQL,PostgreSQL,ODBC

NOTE: Before using ODBC connection you must setup it.
Use the ODBC option in Control Panel to setup a system DSN 
for the application database. The database file is located 
in the main folder of the application. In the interest of 
security, you can and are encouraged to move the database 
file to a more secure location outside the web server 
hierarchy. Your application will work fine as long as the 
DSN you configure points to the correct location of the 
database file. Ensure that the DSN is a system DSN so that 
it will be available to all users.

(a) Open the file 'var_definition_example.php' which is in the 'includes' folder of your application path. 

(b) Look for the connection parameters: $db_host, $db_user, $db_password, $db_name, $db_type 

(c) Using the guidelines below, change the statement to look something like the example shown below: 
// database parameters 
$db_type = "mysql"; 
$db_name = "viart_shop"; 
$db_user = "viart_shop"; 
$db_password = "best2004os"; 
$db_host = "localhost"; 

where: 
$db_type : type of database that you use. It can be - 'mysql', 'postgre', 'odbc'. 
$db_name : Refers to the database name. 
$db_user and $db_password : Used to specify user authentication values. 
$db_host : This is the name of computer where database server resides. 
           Default value is localhost. 

(d) Save file 'var_definition_example.php' as 'var_definition.php'

================================================================================

6. PHP for Windows 
For PHP for Windows do the following: 

(a) Open php.ini (it can be found in the Windows folder) 
(b) Find session.save_path parameter. 
E.g.: session.save_path = C:\Program Files\PHP\sessiondata\ ; 
argument passed to save_handler 
(c) Verify that set as a value for this parameter exists and not a Read-Only 
file for the Web-Server. 

================================================================================

7. Verify if all things works 
To verify if all things works simply point your browser to 
http://"your_web_server"/"path_to_ViArt_Shop" 
where: 

"your_web_server" - might be "localhost" or (if installed on remote web server) internet domain name like "www.your_company.com". 
"path_to_ViArt_Shop" - The directory within web-server hierarchy where ViArt Shop was installed.
