"What a great idea, I've always hated looking up my filter info in the catalog at the auto parts store - I found my filter and received my order right on time.  Thanks."<br />
-  Harold T., Kingstown, RI
<br /><br />
"I was looking online for some information about motor oil and come across your site which seemed to have everything I needed.  I purchased three oil filters and a case of oil just like that :)"<br />
-  Matthew M., Tucson, AZ
<br /><br />
"The information and approach you have taken with your site is refreshing. I'm no mechanic so I appreciate that fact that your site doesn't assume that I am."<br />
-  Heather D., Edison, NJ
<br /><br />
"I've been changing my own oil all my life and even I learned a few things checking out your site.  My local auto parts store never has my filter in stock for my Subaru, so I have to make two trips to the store - which is a huge pain.  I used your filter finder and you had my filter in stock and delivered it in two days, I couldn't be happier."<br />
-  Michael G., San Carlos, CA

"I just used the recycling center locator and found an auto parts store with an oil recycling center 4 miles from my house that I didn't know existed; what a wonderful tool!!! Thanks"<br />
-  Susan M., Fort Walton Beach, FL
<br /><br />
"You just saved me a ton of time.  I found my filters and oil, for two cars, and placed my order in record time; don't change a thing except perhaps to add brake pads to your site."<br />
-  Sam B., Winchester, ID
<br /><br />
"You're on to something good here with your website.  I've been frustrated almost every time I've taken my car to get my oil changed for one reason or another.  I have had everything from a leaky filter to overfilling my engine so now I only change my own oil, and have been happy ever since.  Now that I can buy my supplies online I'm even happier."<br />
-  Phil L., New York, NY
<br /><br />
"I love that my filter was packaged with some free shop towels and rubber gloves, that was a nice touch that you didn't need to do. I used them to change my own oil for the first time...with my boyfriend's assistance."<br />
-  Michelle D., Irvine, CA
