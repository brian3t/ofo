<div class="title2">Earn 20% While Helping Others Save Time and Money With Oil Change Supplies</div>
</p>
<p>
The best online marketing opportunities are those with (a) the largest potential customer base and (b) the fewest potential solution options, right?
</p>
<p>
What's the most bothersome and time consuming problem associated with car maintenance?
</p>
<p>
Modern vehicles don't require a lot of maintenance; but they do require an oil and oil filter change several times a year which usually requires a significant disruption to the owner's weekly routine - but it doesn't have to.
</p>
<p>
OilFiltersOnline.com is a niche site dedicated to solving the problems associated with Do-It-Yourself light vehicle maintenance. Until now this space has been neglected online, other than by the large chain stores, who provide so many products that it is very difficult to find what the customer needs. These big sites also offer very little information and direction about the parts and processes involved. 
</p>
<p>
<div class="title2">The Ideal Marketing Scenario</div></p>
<p>
The aftermarket automotive industry sells <b>over 50 Billion dollars of parts and accessories</b> each year and here is your opportunity to participate in some of that revenue. Almost everybody has a car, right; and we are all short of time and money - making this the perfect web product opportunity. Some of the critical information that OilFiltersOnline.com provides is its Used Motor Oil Recycling Facility Finder and its Filter Finder. Our average order size is $36 and growing. In the future we will be adding additional parts along with their associated installation instructions.
</p>
<p>
With a tough economy and high gas prices, this is a perfect way for people to save money - by changing their own oil. By buying their products online our customers don't even have to waste the time going to the auto parts store to buy the oil, parts and tools they need; we deliver them to their doorstep.
