<p><strong>Delivery Times</strong></p>
<p>Delivery times can vary for each product based on the delivery location, the location of our warehouse with the part in stock, and the size of the product.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>How is my total delivery time determined?</strong></p>
<p>The total delivery time for your order is calculated from the time your order is placed until the time you receive it. Delivery Time is broken down into pre-ship processing time and shipping time.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Pre-Ship Processing Time</strong> is the time it takes from when you submit your order to when the product leaves the warehouse. This time is needed for products that are shipped to you directly from one of our warehouses. The shipping departments need this time to fulfill your order and in some cases this process can take up to 48 hours; but most orders are fulfilled within 24 hours, and we try to get all orders out that we receive before noon PST out that same day.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Shipping Time</strong> is measured from when your order leaves the warehouse to when it arrives at your home or office.  This time is strongly dependent on the shipping method you select.  Ground shipping can take take as little as 1 day and as much as 5 days for delivery.<br />
