One of the best things you can do to ensure that your car or truck is getting the best mileage possible is to check your air filter and make sure that it is clean and oil free.  A dirty air filter can throw off the fuel air mixture slightly and prevent your engine from running at it's maximum efficiency potential. So if your air filter is dirty and you're losing even a fraction of a mile per gallon - the cost of fuel you are wasting can really add up.
